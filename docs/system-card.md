# System Card — Livicity CWVS / AWVS Reference Package

## Intended use
Decision-support for child-impact reasoning in CIA/CRIA workflows: structuring evidence, surfacing cross-domain dependencies, documenting uncertainty, and producing auditable artifacts.

## Users
Public institutions, child-rights organizations, practitioners, and policy teams. Outputs may also be shared in accountability dialogues with stakeholders.

## Key safeguards
- Human-in-the-loop required (no automated decisions)
- No diagnosis, prediction, or profiling of individuals
- Provenance fields required for impact claims
- Uncertainty must be declared; missing-data prompts are mandatory where applicable
- NDC (neurodevelopmental conditions) accessibility filter modulates outputs qualitatively (no numeric scoring)

## Known limitations
- Early schema; not production-ready
- Requires context-aware human judgment
- Cross-sector comparability depends on evidence quality and adapter configuration
