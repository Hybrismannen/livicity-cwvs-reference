# Livicity CWVS / AWVS — Reference Package (Public)

This repository contains the public reference package for Livicity’s Child Wellbeing Vectorfields Scan (CWVS) and an Adult Wellbeing Vector Scan (AWVS) extension.

Purpose: provide an open, auditable “child-impact intelligence layer” that supports CIA/CRIA workflows with inspectable artifacts (vector scan + explainability + provenance), not automated decisions.

## What exists here (v0.1)
- Draft open schema (CWVS; AWVS stub) for vectors, evidence provenance, uncertainty, participation inputs, and audit fields
- Governance and safety artifacts (system card, misuse boundaries, deployment checklist)
- Synthetic examples (inputs and outputs) — no sensitive personal data

## What this is NOT
- Not an automated decision system
- Not a diagnostic or predictive profiling tool
- Not a scoring/ranking tool for individual children
- Not a replacement for professional judgment

## Outputs (reference)
- Vector scan (radar-ready structure)
- Explainability card (“what claim; based on what; what’s missing; what human review is required”)
- Alternatives comparison (A/B scan deltas)
- Follow-up / monitoring prompts

## Roadmap
- v0.2: schema refinement + sector adapters (planning, education, social services, digital services)
- v0.3: minimal reference implementation (scan engine) and demo dashboard

## Licensing
- Code: MIT License
- Documentation: (add your preferred doc license, e.g., CC BY 4.0)
